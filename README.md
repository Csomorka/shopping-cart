# ðŸ›’ Shopping Cart Project (React)

This is a basic shopping cart app built with React. It fetches products from a mock JSON server and allows users to:

- View and add products to the cart
- Adjust item quantities (+ / -)
- See the total price
- Conditionally render cart summary
  -Removing items from the cart
- (Coming soon: improved styling, code refactor)

## ðŸ§ª Tech Stack

- React (with useReducer)
- Mock JSON Server (`http://localhost:3001`)
- Functional components
- Prop drilling (Context API planned)

## ðŸš§ Status

Currently a work-in-progress. Some functionality and styling are incomplete.

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
